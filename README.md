RedReader Beta (for Android)
============================

An unofficial, open source client for reddit.

Features
--------

* Free and Open Source - no ads/tracking.
* Swipe posts left and right to perform customisable actions, such as upvote/downvote, or save/hide.
* Advanced cache management - automatically stores past versions of posts and comments.
* Streaming - shows posts/comments as they download - good for slow connections.
* Support for multiple accounts.
* Two-column tablet mode (can be used on your phone, if it's big enough)
* Image precaching (optional: always, never, or Wi-Fi only).
* Built in image viewer, and GIF player.
* Compression - both during downloads, and in cache storage.
* Night mode (i.e. a dark theme)
* Holo theme on every device
* Support for Android 2.2+ (but works best on Android 4.0+)


Reporting Bugs
--------------

RedReader is beta software, so it is possible that you may encounter bugs.

Details of each crash in the UI thread will be logged to external storage, under the filename "redreader_crash_log_(UUID).txt" - please attach the relevant log when reporting a bug.

Crashes in other parts of the application will cause a prompt to be displayed asking you to email the exception details directly.


How to Build
------------

RedReader is built using Maven. Several dependencies are required (and listed in pom.xml), but these are handled automatically if you use Maven.

Detailed instructions on building RedReader using IntelliJ IDEA are in [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

----------

RedReader is available for free on the Google Play store:
